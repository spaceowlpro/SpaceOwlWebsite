[Welcome]
#My name is Kurt!#
I'm an artist who primarily works on coding projects including grant funded apps and websites. I'm specifically interested in exploring how we can be entertained by immersive digital art without relying on environmentally costly technologies. Our world is becoming increasingly reliant on high res graphics and wasteful AI. This is not the only way forward and it surely isn't the best way.
#This is my website!#
It is built completely in the terminal with vim. I wrote a javascript file that scrubs a plain-text file that I use to populate the website rather than having to update html every time I want to add something to the page. This is in line with my goals to decouple myself from fancy api's made by large coorporations that try to draw you in and become reliant on their instantly gratifying, do-everything-for-you systems.

I didn't google a system to copy. I thought up a way that I would most enjoy creating my website and I built it with html, css, and js.

Currently, this site is being hosted with no backend, so the text file is being parsed every time a user opens the website, the js code running on their machine. While this isn't very wasteful considering the size of the file, I'd like to eventually host it on my solar server, and run the parsing and build the html once in the back end rather than every time a user visits the page.

Cornhole is a game I'm working on for the Playdate, the little yellow handheld console with a crank. Follow along here for updates on where it's at. Currently I'm focused on writing dialogue for the story mode.

SoundWalk is a longterm project that uses GPS on phones to drive audio experiences. It started as a small dream to create musical scores for public spaces. I imagined being able to compose music that was mapped to a park, and have it change as the listener moved through the space. It ended up being more of a tool for social causes, specifically as a way to tell the marginalized stories and histories of an area.

This is a solar server that runs from my house and takes data measured at Dirt Wain, a composting company in Fort Wayne, IN, to generate online art pieces.

#Inland Empire - 1/25/25#
So, tonight I watched Inland Empire for the first time and truly experienced pure cinema. It sounds hilarious and hyperbolic to say out loud, but it's really how I'm feeling.

A friend of mine lent me the Blu-Ray and was recently asking me for it back because he wants to watch through Lynch's filmography after his recent passing. I told him that I still haven't gotten to watch it, but of course he can have it back. "Maybe I'll borrow it again after that. I keep meaning to watch it but I haven't had the chance to be alone with it and give it my attention." Well, today before I had to give it back, my partner happened to have some plans to see some friends. We went to my niece's and nephew's joint birthday party with a house full of screaming kids and then after that she went to her friends' thing and I went home to watch the film.

I was feeling tired, so I made cup of coffee, put the film in and cranked the speakers. The experience of watching the film was all sorts of ups and downs. I can't lie. There were a few moments where I felt the length of the film and wondered if the film was nearing its end. Watching the film was like falling into deep trances and then waking up. Repeatedly. The film tugs at linear narratives and then falls into abstraction in a push and pull that I now feel put me into some sort of meditative state. There are sequences that had me crying that came out of nowhere. As if I was just another of the many subjects on screen being pulled in and out of the cinematic experience of creation and observation.

When the film came to an end and Nina Simone's Sinnerman was blasting, I was still in this deep trance when my partner suddenly appeared next to me in the darkness. She had arrived home from her party. At that moment the cat jumped down the stairs in a clash and made a loud commotion that truly startled me. It felt like the most appropriate way to end the film experience. I haven't been drinking much lately, but the buzz of the coffee and the film made me want to grab a bottle of wine as a comedown. I stumbled to even remember my birthday when the person at the store asked me. 

Expressing to both Sarah and my friend who lent me the film a soup of thoughts about what I just experienced: 

I think this is the most movie ass movie I've ever seen. Lynch expresses a truth in this film that can only be expressed through sound and images, and someone watching that on the screen. Like I said, it sounds hyperbolic and ridiculous to say, but my experience was the purest dialogue between myself the viewer and sound and image from an artist that I've ever experienced. I wanted to write this down to capture the feeling before it went away.

Once I got home from the store with the bottle of wine, I hugged Sarah for an extended period that she even remarked upon. The film filled me with a gratitude for life and my love with her. In the past, the only film to illicit any similar reaction to was Synecdoche New York, which I would say is a similar film to this but I think that would do a disservice to this film. I think there's nothing else like it, and I'm so glad I finally experienced it.

If you're reading this, I recommend you spend a few hours with family, go home tired and watch Inland Empire at full volume and disappear into the flashing images and sound for 3 hours. It's one of the best things I've done in a while.
