[Welcome]
This is my website! I use it to log my current projects. I'm still building it, so you're just seeing my progress as I do! The website is built completely in the terminal with vim. I'm writing a javascript file that scrubs a plain-text file that I use to populate the website, rather than having to update html every time I want to add something.

Cornhole is a game I'm working on for the Playdate, the little yellow handheld console with a crank. Follow along here for updates on where it's at. Currently I'm focused on writing dialogue for the story mode.

[SoundWalk]
SoundWalk is a longterm project that uses GPS on phones to drive audio experiences. I'm currently working on a new experience for the app for the Fort Wayne Urban League about it's rich history. Stay tuned for more!

This is a solar server that runs from my house and takes data measured at Dirt Wain, a composting company in Fort Wayne, IN, to generate online art pieces.
